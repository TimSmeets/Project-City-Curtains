			    <h3>Sydney Tower Eye</h3>
				<br/>
				Sydney Tower is Sydney's tallest structure and the second tallest observation tower in the Southern Hemisphere. The name Sydney Tower has become common in daily usage; however, the tower has been variously known as Centrepoint Tower (or just Centrepoint) and AMP Tower, and colloquially as Flower Tower, Glower Tower, and Big Poke. The tower stands 305 m (1,001 ft) 
				above the Sydney central business district (CBD), located on Market Street, between Pitt and Castlereagh Streets.[1] It is accessible from the Pitt Street Mall, Market Street or Castlereagh Street and sits above the Westfield Sydney (formerly Centrepoint) shopping centre. The tower is open to the public, and is one of the most prominent tourist attractions in the city,
				being visible from a number of vantage points throughout town and from adjoining suburbs.
