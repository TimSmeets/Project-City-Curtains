						<h3><b>Gateway plaza</h3></b>
						<br/>
						Macquarie Place (also known as Gateway Plaza) is an iconic Sydney skyscraper on Macquarie Place in Central Business District of Sydney, Australia.

						Designed by architect Peddle, Thorp & Walker, the blue glass-clad commercial office building reaches 46 storeys or 164 metres (538 ft) to the top of its spire, and it is very prominent on the Circular Quay waterfront. The tower contains about 470,000 square feet (44,000m²) of office space.

						<h3><b>Governor philip tower</h3></b>
						<br/>
						he Governor Phillip Tower, the Governor Macquarie Tower, and the Museum of Sydney are the main elements of one of the largest developments in the central business district of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Completed in 1994, the property development complex occupies an elevated site in the north-east area of the central business district. The complex incorporates the site of the first Government House, one of Australia's earliest and most significant sites of European heritage. The address is 1 Farrer Place, Sydney. Designed by architects Denton Corker Marshall and built by Australia's largest privately owned construction company Grocon, at the time of its completion it was regarded as achieving new standards for Sydney commercial architecture in terms of finish quality and design.

						<h3><b>Aurora place</h3></b>
						<br/>
						Aurora Place is an office skyscraper and residential block on Macquarie Street in Sydney, Australia. Designed by Renzo Piano, the 41-storey building stands at a height of 218 m (715 ft) high to the top of the spire and 188 m (617 ft) to the roof.

The building has an unusual geometric shape where not one panel is parallel to any grid. The east façade bulges out slightly from its base, reaching its maximum width at the top floors. The curved and twisted shape of east façade is aimed to correspond spatially with Sydney Opera House and to represent the sublime marine environment of the harbour. The exterior glass curtain-wall extends beyond the main frame, creating an illusion of its independence. The steel spire attached to the north facade is 75 metres in length.

Uniquely for an office building of its size and age, Aurora Place features a number of winter gardens, providing natural environments for the building's tenants. These winter gardens are located in the North West and South East corners of the tower floor place, facing Sydney Harbour and the adjacent botanical gardens, with sophisticated operable louvre facades.

						<h3><b>1 Bligh street tower</h3></b>
						The premium grade office tower/ 1 bligh street tower was designed by Ingenhoven Architects of Germany and Architectus of Australia.

It is an ecologically sustainable development and was awarded six-star green status by the Green Building Council of Australia. Green features include a basement sewage plant that recycles 90 percent of the building waste water, solar panels on the roof and air conditioning by chilled beams. It is Australia's first major high-rise building with a full double-skin façade with external louvres. These conserve energy, eliminate sky glare and optimise user comfort. The angle of the louvre blades is automatically adjusted according to their orientation to the sun. A naturally ventilated, full height atrium, on the southern side of the building, maximises natural light to each office level.

The building also houses a childcare centre, two cafés and a basement car park for 96 cars.

The large-scale aluminium sculpture at the top of the curving steps at the entrance on the corner of Bligh and O'Connell streets is by New York-based Australian James Angus. The developers describe it as "a complex network of three-dimensional ellipsoidal surfaces drawn from shapes expressed in the design of the building", adding that its brightly painted colour scheme traces the underlying geometry of the sculpture.
